### Files to Modify:
- `app/dashboard/admin/users/page.tsx` - Main users management page

### API Endpoints Used:
- `PUT /api/users/[id]` - Existing endpoint for role updates

### Security Considerations:
- ✅ Only admins can change roles (existing API validation)
- ✅ Proper session validation (existing)
- ✅ Prevent admin from demoting themselves
- ✅ Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- ✅ Prevent admin from deleting themselves

### Features Added:
1. **Quick Role Actions**: Direct "Promote to Admin" and "Demote to Customer" buttons in dropdown
2. **Smart UI**: Shows appropriate action based on current user role
3. **Safety Checks**: Prevents admins from demoting or deleting themselves
4. **Confirmation Dialogs**: Clear warnings about role change consequences
5. **Real-time Updates**: UI updates immediately after successful role changes
6. **Enhanced Dropdown**: Added Edit action and better organization with separators
7. **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded actions (green for promote, orange for demote, red for delete)
8. **Loading States**: Shows "Cambiando..." during role change operations
